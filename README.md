# Work Log
Bash script to get a work log from last week (more customizations soon!) from JIRA, Toggle Track, and Git

## Get started
1. Clone the repo.
2. From inside the repo folder, run `bash work_log.sh init`.
3. Now the initial configuration is done, you can go to any of your projects and run `work_log`.
4. In the first time, you'll be asked to install a few requied dependencies, also, you'll be prompted to enter a few configuration values.

# To Do
- [ ] Check if user is inside a .git directory
- [ ] Improvements on init config: Check if, when init command was ran,it is in the correct folder (with the script file)
